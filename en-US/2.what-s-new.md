# What's New

OBLOADER & OBDUMPER V4.0.0 released in December 2022 allows you to import and export TYPE object definitions as well as data files (compressed by default) in column-oriented storage formats of ORC and Parquet. This version also weakens its dependency on sys tenant privileges, optimizes data export performance (for tables with primary keys or with non-null unique keys), and upgrades versions of components that the underlying layer depends on. The JDBC driver is upgraded to V2.2.11, and the partition calculator component is upgraded to 1.4.0-RELEASE. In addition, some feature defects in earlier versions are fixed.

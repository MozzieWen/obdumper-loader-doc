# Prepare the environment

Before you run OBLOADER & OBDUMPER, make sure that you have the appropriate operating environment and privileges.

## Operating environment configurations



| **Configuration item** | **Requirements** |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| OS | Linux, macOS, and Windows 7 or later  |
| Java environment | Install Oracle JDK 1.8, and configure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.  **We do not recommend that you use OpenJDK.**  |
| Character set | We recommend that you use UTF-8 as the file character set.  |
| Java virtual machine (JVM) parameters | Modify the JVM memory parameter in the bin/obloader and bin/obdumper scripts to avoid JVM memory insufficiency.  |

> **Note**  
> Due to serious garbage collection (GC) bugs in some versions of OpenJDK 1.8, an out of memory (OOM) error or a hang will occur when OBLOADER & OBDUMPER is running. Therefore, install the latest minor version of OpenJDK 1.8.

## Privileges

### OBLOADER

When you connect OBLOADER to OceanBase Database and use this tool to import data, you must have the following privileges:

* The user account that you use to connect to OceanBase Database must have the privileges to execute the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `MERGE`, and `UPDATE` statements. You can view the privileges granted to a user by using the `SHOW GRANTS` statement. Example:

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW GRANTS FOR user1;
   +----------------------------------------+
   | Grants for user1@%                     |
   +----------------------------------------+
   | GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'user1'         |
   | GRANT INSERT ON `db1`.* TO 'user1'     |
   | GRANT MERGE ON `db1`.* TO 'user1'      |
   | GRANT UPDATE ON `db1`.* TO 'user1'     |
   | GRANT VIEW ON `db1`.* TO 'user1'       |
   +----------------------------------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* In versions earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0.0.0, you need to specify the `--sys-user` and `--sys-password` options on the command line of OBLOADER & OBDUMPER. For more information, see [Scenarios and examples](../5.OBLOADER/5.obloader-scenarios.md) in the OBLOADER section.


   > **Notice**<br>
   > The `--sys-user` and `--sys-password` options must be set to the username and password of a user with system table and view query privileges under the sys tenant.

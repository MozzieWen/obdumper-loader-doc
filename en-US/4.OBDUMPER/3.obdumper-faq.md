2. Why does the control file configured for a table fail to take effect when I import data to or export data from the table? 

   The name of the control file must be identical to the table name. By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode and in uppercase in Oracle mode.

   The name of the control file must be identical to the table name. By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode.
   

4. Why does OBDUMPER not generate an empty data file when it exports an empty table? 

   By default, OBDUMPER does not use an empty table to generate an empty file. You can specify the `--retain-empty-files` option to generate an empty file for an empty table.
   

5. Why are command-line options not parsed as expected when I run the OBLOADER or OBDUMPER script? 

   This issue may occur if command-line options contain special characters. 

   If you run OBLOADER or OBDUMPER on a Linux operating system, a greater-than sign (\>) in the password may cause the loss of all operational logs. The greater-than sign (\>) is a redirection operator. Therefore, you must use appropriate quotation marks to resolve this issue on different operating systems.
   

6. What do I do if the `SELECT command denied to user 'xxx'@'%' for table SYS.XXX` error is reported when I query views? 

   This error is reported because you are not authorized to access internal tables and views. Run the following statement to obtain required privileges: `GRANT SELECT SYS.XXX TO xxx;`.
   

7. What do I do if the following error is reported when I start OBLOADER or OBDUMPER: `Access denied for user 'root'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'`? 

   By default, OBLOADER and OBDUMPER require the privileges of the root user. If you have set a password for the root user under the SYS tenant in the cluster, specify the configured password in the `--sys-password` option in the command.
   

8. What do I do if the `Connection reset` error is reported after I use the `--query-sql` option to specify large query statements for OBDUMPER? 

   Log on to the SYS tenant, and set the `client_tcp_user_timeout` and `server_tcp_user_timeout` parameters of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to 0.
   

9. What do I do if the following error is reported when I use OBDUMPER to export data: `The target directory: "xxx" is not empty`? 

   To prevent data overwriting, OBDUMPER checks whether the destination directory is empty before the export. You can specify the `--skip-check-dir` option to skip this check.
   

10. What do I do if the following error is reported when I use OBDUMPER to export data: `Request to read too old versioned data`? 

    This error is reported because the data version on which the current query depends has been recycled. You need to set an UNDO retention period in seconds as needed. Example: `set global undo_retention=xxx`.

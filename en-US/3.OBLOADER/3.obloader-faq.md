1. How do I run OBLOADER or OBDUMPER in debugging mode? 

   Run the debugging script, such as obloader-debug and obdumper-debug, in the bin directory. ![obloader-faq-debug](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2002878461/p409986.png)
   

2. After data in a large table is exported by partition into several files with indefinite extensions, how can I import them by using OBLOADER? 

   You can specify a regular expression for file name extensions in the command. 

   For example, if the names of the data files that you want to import are test.tbl.0, test.tbl.1, and test.tbl, you can specify the following options in the command: `--table test --file-suffix '^.{1}\\w+.{1}\\d+'`. You must write a valid regular expression. Otherwise, the system prompts that no data files are found.
   

3. How do I use OBLOADER to import a data file whose name is different from the table? 

   Generally, the `-f` option specifies the absolute path of a visible, readable, and writable directory. Example: `--table 't1,2' -f '/root/output'`. 

   However, you can also use the `-f` option to specify a data file. Example: `--table 'test' -f '/output/hello.csv'`.
   

4. Why does the control file configured for a table fail to take effect when I import data to or export data from the table? 

   The name of the control file must be identical to the table name. By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode and in uppercase in Oracle mode.
   

5. Why does the control file configured for a table fail to take effect when I import data to or export data from the table? 

   The name of the control file must be identical to the table name. By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode.
   

6. Why are command-line options not parsed as expected when I run the OBLOADER or OBDUMPER script? 

   This issue may occur if command-line options contain special characters. 

   If you run OBLOADER or OBDUMPER on a Linux operating system, a greater-than sign (\>) in the password may cause the loss of all operational logs. The greater-than sign (\>) is a redirection operator. Therefore, you must use appropriate quotation marks to resolve this issue on different operating systems. For more information, see the next question.
   

7. When do I need to enclose options in single quotation marks (' ') or double quotation marks (" ") when I run the OBLOADER or OBDUMPER script? 

   We recommend that you enclose complex options such as passwords and cluster names in quotation marks. 
   * On the Windows operating system, use double quotation marks (" "). Example: `--table "*"`.

     
   
   * On a Linux-like operating system, use single quotation marks (' '). Example: `--table '*'`.

     
   

   

8. What do I do if external files fail to be imported due to invalid file formats? 

   * Import an SQL file:

     The SQL file can contain only INSERT statements but not comments or SET statements. Each INSERT statement cannot occupy multiple lines. If the file contains DDL or DML statements, we recommend that you run MySQL commands to import it.
     
   
   * Import a CSV file:

     The content of the CSV file must be in the standard CSV format and contain column and row delimiters. We recommend that you enclose string-type column values in quotation marks. By default, you need to use single quotation marks (' '). In addition, you must escape the column values enclosed by single quotation marks (' ').
     
   

   

9. What do I do if the following error is reported when I start OBLOADER or OBDUMPER: `Access denied for user 'root'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'`? 

   By default, OBLOADER and OBDUMPER require the privileges of the root user. If you have set a password for the root user under the SYS tenant in the cluster, specify the configured password in the `--sys-password` option in the command.
   

10. What do I do if one of the following errors is reported when OBLOADER is running: `Over tenant memory limits` and `No memory or reach tenant memory limit`?
    Increase the percentage of tenant memory, or specify a lower value for the `--thread` option to reduce the concurrency. Sample code: 

    ```unknow
    set global ob_sql_work_area_percentage=30; -- Default 5
    ```

    

11. What do I do if the following error is reported when OBLOADER is running: `No tables are exists in the schema: "xxx"`? 

    For example, if you specify the `--table 't1,t2'` option, t1 and t2 must be the table names that you have already defined in the database. Make sure that the letter case of the specified table names is consistent with that of the table names defined in the database. 

    By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode and in uppercase in Oracle mode. To specify a lowercase table name in Oracle mode, you must include the table name in brackets (\[ \]). Example: `--table '[t1]'`. 

    By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode.
    

12. What do I do if the following error is reported when OBLOADER is running: `The xxx files are not found in the path: "xxx"`? 

    The name of the data file in the directory specified by the `-f` option must be identical to the table name. 

    By default, table names are in lowercase in MySQL mode and in uppercase in Oracle mode. For example, if you specify `--table 't1'`, the data file in the directory must be named t1 in a supported format, such as t1.csv and t1.sql. Other file names such as T1.csv are invalid.
    

13. What do I do if the following error is reported when OBLOADER is running: `The manifest file: "xxx" is missing`? 

    MANIFEST.bin is a metadata file that is generated when you export data by using OBDUMPER. If you use other tools to import data, no metadata file is generated. You can specify the `--external-data` option to skip the check of metadata files.
    

14. What do I do if the following error is reported when I use OBLOADER to import a delimited text file: `Index: 0, Size: 0`? 

    This error occurs if the data file contains carriage returns or line feeds. You must run a script to delete the carriage returns or line feeds from the data file before you import it.

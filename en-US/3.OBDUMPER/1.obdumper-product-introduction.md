Overview 
=============================


What is OBDUMPER? 
--------------------------------------

OBDUMPER is a client data export tool developed in Java. You can use it to export data and the DDL statements of objects in OceanBase Database to files. 

OBDUMPER has the following advantages over other export tools such as MyDumper and SQL Developer:

* Higher performance: OBDUMPER is specifically optimized for partitioned tables and tables without a primary key.
* More features: OBDUMPER provides various features, including data preprocessing, support for various data formats, and global consistent nonlocking export.


Features 
-----------------------------

OBDUMPER mainly provides the following features:

* Allows you to export the DDL statements of database objects.

  

* Allows you to export table data to files in the CSV or SQL format.

  

* Allows you to export data from some partitions of a partitioned table by specifying the partition names.

  

* Allows you to specify global filters to export only the data that meets the specified conditions.

  

* Allows you to configure data preprocessing rules to convert data before export.

  

* Allows you to upload exported data to Object Storage Service (OSS).

  

* Allows you to export data from a follower replica of an OceanBase cluster (which is different from a standby cluster).

  

* Allows you to export custom query result sets in the SQL, CSV, and CUT formats.

  

* Ensures global consistency for the exported data by reading the snapshot version when tables are not locked.

  




Supported OceanBase Database versions 
----------------------------------------------------------

The following table describes OceanBase Database versions and modes that are supported.


| **OceanBase Database mode** |                                                 **Supported version**                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MySQL mode              | 1.4.70, 1.4.72, 1.4.75, 1.4.78, 1.4.79, 2.2.30, 2.2.50, 2.2.70, 2.2.71, 2.2.72, 2.2.76, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x |


> **Notice**  
> OBDUMPER 3.0.0 supports OceanBase Community Edition 3.1.2 and later.

Usage notes 
--------------------------------

* For more information about the standard CSV format, see the [RFC 4180](http://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/rfc/inline-errata/rfc4180.html) specifications. We recommend that you export data in strict accordance with the [RFC 4180](http://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/rfc/inline-errata/rfc4180.html) specifications.

  

* You need to modify the VM memory parameter in the script when you try to export a large amount of data.

  

* The object names, data file names, and rule file names specified by command-line options must be capitalized in the same way. By default, lowercase letters are used in MySQL mode. 

  

* To improve the data export performance, we recommend that you trigger a major compaction before you export data.

  

* All exported data files are named in the table.group.sequence.suffix format.

  

* If a foreign key contains several columns, the order of the columns might change after the export. Example: FOREIGN KEY(c1,c2) REFERENCE (c1,c2).

  

* OceanBase Database 1.4.72 in MySQL mode does not allow you to export the definitions of unique prefix indexes. Example: UNIQUE(c1(10)).

  

* OceanBase Database 1.4.x in MySQL mode does not allow you to export the definitions of generated columns. For example, columns generated by using the GENERATED ALWAYS AS (expr) statement cannot be exported.

  

* OceanBase Database 2.2.7x in MySQL mode does not allow you to export vertical partitions. For example, partitions created by using the PARTITION BY COLUMN statement cannot be exported.

  

* OceanBase Database 2.2.7x in MySQL mode does not allow you to export the definitions of SYNONYM objects.

  

* OceanBase Database 2.2.7x in MySQL mode does not allow you to export columns that store index data. For example, columns in STORING(COLUMN_LIST) cannot be exported.

  

* On the Windows OS, the exclamation point (!) cannot be used as a delimiter. An object name in the database cannot contain special characters \\ / : \* ? " \< \> \| Otherwise, neither the database object definitions nor the table data can be exported.

  




Limited mode 
---------------------------------

> **Note**  
> The limited mode is applicable to scenarios where you cannot directly specify the `--sys-user` or `--sys-password` option.

* If you enable the limited mode (by specifying `--public-cloud`) when you export data from an OceanBase cluster deployed in a public cloud, you do not need to specify the `-t` or `-c` option. When you export data in limited mode from an OceanBase cluster deployed in a private cloud, you must specify the `-t` option, and additionally the `-c` option for using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). If you do not enable the limited mode, the `--sys-user` and `--sys-password` options must be specified for OBDUMPER.
  

* If you enable the limited mode (by specifying `--public-cloud`) when you export object definitions, you can export definitions of only tables and views. Table definitions cannot contain index and comment information. In addition, data export performance in limited mode is lower than that in unlimited mode.
